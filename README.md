# OSRS_Nightmare_Zone_calculator

Note: probably outdated.

Also note: this was a fun little project and the code was never meant to be nice and readable. Sorry.


Contains three parts:
1. DPS calculator
2. Reverse enginered NMZ points formula
3. Breadth first search algorithm

Together they calculate the optimal boss selection for points, based on your gear and stats
